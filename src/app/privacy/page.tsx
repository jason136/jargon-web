      <h2>Privacy Policy for Jargon Chrome Extension</h2>
      <h3>Who We Are and the Purpose of this Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to Jargon, a chrome extension designed to provide in-context
        language learning for everyday use by integrating seamlessly into your
        internet browsing experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains the privacy practices of Jargon
        (“we,” “us,” “our” or “Jargon”) relating to your access and use of
        Jargon&apos;s Services. This Policy is designed to help you better
        understand how we collect, use, store, and share any personal
        information about you (your “Personal Data”). It also describes your
        rights in relation to your Personal Data. Under data protection law, the
        term Personal Data refers to all information that relates to an
        identified or identifiable person. At Jargon, we only process Personal
        Data in compliance with applicable data protection laws and regulations.
        Jargon is responsible as the controller for the data processing
        described in this Policy, unless stated otherwise. The term “controller”
        under data protection law refers to the entity which decides what to do
        with the Personal Data that has been collected, and how to do it. This
        Policy is incorporated into the Terms and is a part and parcel of the
        Terms. By registering for or using any of our Services, you consent to
        the collection, transfer, processing, storage, and other uses of your
        information as described in this Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may update this Policy from time to time by publishing a new version
        on our website. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new
        Privacy Policy on this page and through in-app notifications. You are
        advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
      </p>
      <h3>1. On what basis do we process your Personal Data?</h3>

        Jargon account), (iii) for compliance by Jargon with a legal obligation,
        or (iv) if the processing is necessary for the protection of our
        legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party,
