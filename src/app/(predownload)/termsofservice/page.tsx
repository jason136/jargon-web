      <h2>TERMS OF USE</h2>
      Last Revised on June 1, 2024.
      <p>
        These Terms of Use (these “Terms” or “Terms of Service”) set forth the
        terms and conditions that apply to your access and use of (i) the
        websites, (ii) software applications and other online services, together
        with any content, tools, features and functionality offered on or
        through such websites, software applications and other online services,
        including the Jargon extension for web browsers and the Jar (the
        “Extension”) (collectively, the “Services”) provided by Jargon
        (“Company”, “we” or “us” or “Jargon”). We are currently in the process
        of forming a legal entity and will update this Policy with the official
        business name upon registration. The Extension is a software application
        that integrates language learning into your browsing experience. The
        &apos;Jar&apos; is a database within the Extension where users can see
        learned vocabulary and review completed quizzes.
      </p>
      <p>
        These Terms govern your access to and use of the Services. Please read
        these Terms carefully, as they include important information about your
        legal rights. By accessing and/or using the Services, you are agreeing
        to these Terms. If you do not understand or agree to these Terms, please
        do not use the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        For purposes of these Terms, “you” and “your” means you as the user of
        the Services. If you use the Services on behalf of a company or other
        entity then “you” includes you and that entity, and you represent and
        warrant that (a) you are an authorized representative of the entity with
        the authority to bind the entity to these Terms, and (b) you agree to
        these Terms on the entity&apos;s behalf.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that Section 10 contains an arbitration clause and class
        action waiver. By agreeing to these Terms, you agree (a) to resolve all
        disputes with us through binding individual arbitration, which means
        that you waive any right to have those disputes decided by a judge or
        jury, and (b) that you waive your right to participate in class actions,
        class arbitrations, or representative actions. You have the right to
        opt-out of arbitration as explained in Section 9.
      </p>

        JARGON STRIVES TO PROVIDE USERS WITH ACCURATE AND UP-TO-DATE LANGUAGE
        LEARNING CONTENT. HOWEVER, THE CONTENT DISPLAYED BY THE EXTENSION,
        INCLUDING THE HIGHLIGHTED TEXT AND GENERATED QUIZZES, IS DERIVED FROM
        VARIOUS WEB SOURCES. JARGON CANNOT GUARANTEE THE ABSOLUTE ACCURACY OR
        COMPLETENESS OF THIS INFORMATION. WE RECOMMEND CONSULTING ADDITIONAL
        RESOURCES, SUCH AS DICTIONARIES OR LANGUAGE LEARNING COURSES, TO VERIFY
        THE INFORMATION PRESENTED. THE QUIZZES GENERATED BY THE EXTENSION ARE
        DESIGNED TO BE A FUN AND ENGAGING WAY TO LEARN FROM YOUR BROWSING
        EXPERIENCE. HOWEVER, THESE QUIZZES MAY NOT ALWAYS REFLECT ALL ASPECTS OF
        PROPER LANGUAGE USAGE IN CONTEXT. THE QUIZZES MAY ALSO HAVE LIMITATIONS
        DUE TO THE AUTOMATED NATURE OF THEIR GENERATION. WE RECOMMEND USING THE
        QUIZZES AS A SUPPLEMENT TO YOUR LANGUAGE LEARNING, NOT AS A SOLE SOURCE
        OF INSTRUCTION.
      </p>
      <p>
        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, JARGON SHALL NOT BE
        LIABLE FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>

          </strong>
          : This includes, but is not limited to, damages for loss of profits,
          business interruption, loss of data, or emotional distress arising out
          of or in connection with your access to or use of the Services, even
          if Jargon has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Accuracy of Language Learning Content</strong>: Jargon strives
          to provide accurate information, but the content displayed by the
          Extension, including highlighted text and generated quizzes, is
          derived from various sources. Jargon cannot guarantee the absolute
          accuracy or completeness of this information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reliance on Quizzes</strong>: The quizzes are for supplemental
          learning and may have limitations due to their automated nature.
          Jargon is not liable for any decisions you make based solely on the
          information presented in the quizzes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Third-Party Content and Services</strong>: The Services may
          contain links to third-party websites or services. Jargon is not
          responsible for the content or practices of these third-party websites
          or services.
        </li>
      </ol>
      JARGON&apos;S TOTAL LIABILITY, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE CLAIM OR
      ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE), SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE
      LESSER OF (A) THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO JARGON FOR THE SERVICES IN THE
      PRECEDING THREE MONTHS, OR (B) $100.00. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
      THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR DAMAGES. IF THESE
      RESTRICTIONS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY.
      <h3>9. INDEMNIFICATION</h3>
      You agree that you shall defend, indemnify and hold us and our affiliates
      and each of our and their respective officers, directors, employees,
      contractors, agents, licensors, and suppliers (the “Company Entities”)
      harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses,
      liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys&apos; fees and costs)
      incurred by the Company Entities arising out of or in connection with: (a)
      your violation or breach of any term of these Terms or any applicable law
      or regulation; (b) your violation of any rights of any third party,
      including but not limited to intellectual property rights or privacy
      rights; (c) your access to or use of the Services, including but not
      limited to misuse of the quiz creation feature or generation of
      inappropriate user-generated content; or (d) your negligence or wilful
      misconduct, including but not limited to the submission of misleading or
      false information within quizzes or User-Generated Content.
      <h3>10. ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Informal Process First.</strong> You agree that in the event of
        any dispute between you and the Company Entities, you will first contact
        us and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before
        resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without
        limitation, any court action.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver.</strong> After
        the informal dispute resolution process, any remaining dispute,
        controversy, or claim (collectively, “Claim”) relating in any way to
        your use of the Services will be resolved by arbitration, including
        threshold questions of arbitrability of the Claim. You and we agree that
        any Claim will be settled by final and binding arbitration, using the
        English language, administered by JAMS under its Comprehensive
        Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “JAMS Rules”) then in effect
        (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this
        section, and as of the date of these Terms). Arbitration will be handled
        by a sole arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Judgment on the
        arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. Any
        arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis –
        class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. You understand
        that by agreeing to these Terms, you and we are each waiving the right
        to trial by jury or to participate in a class action or class
        arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and we will have the
        right to bring an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for
        injunctive or other equitable or conservatory relief, pending a final
        decision by the arbitrator. You may instead assert your claim in “small
        claims” court, but only if your claim qualifies, your claim remains in
        such court and your claim remains on an individual, non-representative
        and non-class basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Costs of Arbitration. </strong>Payment for any and all
        reasonable JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be in
        accordance with the JAMS Rules. If the value of your claim does not
        exceed $10,000, we will pay for the reasonable filing, administrative
        and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, unless the
        arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief
        sought was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Opt-Out.</strong> You have the right to opt-out and not be bound
        by the arbitration provisions set forth in these Terms by sending
        written notice of your decision to opt-out to{" "}

        The notice must be sent to us within thirty (30) days of your
        registering to use the Services or agreeing to these Terms, otherwise
        you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with these Terms.
        If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be
        bound by them.
